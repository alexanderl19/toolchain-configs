# Toolchain Configs

This repo contains shared configurations for tools used for linting, formatting, etc, and is based on the ["with-changesets" turbo example](https://github.com/vercel/turbo/tree/7a9d83956cc6c0145ed5abdedb2080dec753d09b/examples/with-changesets).

## Packages

- `@alexanderliu/prettier-config`: Prettier config
- `@alexanderliu/prettier-config-svelte`: Prettier config with Svelte plugin

### Useful commands

- `yarn build` - Build all packages and the docs site
- `yarn dev` - Develop all packages and the docs site
- `yarn lint` - Lint all packages
- `yarn changeset` - Generate a changeset
- `yarn clean` - Clean up all `node_modules` and `dist` folders (runs each package's clean script)

### Changing the npm organization scope

The npm organization scope for this design system starter is `@acme`. To change this, it's a bit manual at the moment, but you'll need to do the following:

- Rename folders in `packages/*` to replace `acme` with your desired scope
- Search and replace `acme` with your desired scope
- Re-run `yarn install`

## Versioning and Publishing packages

Package publishing has been configured using [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets). Please review their [documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets#documentation) to familiarize yourself with the workflow.

This example comes with automated npm releases setup in a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/changesets/action). To get this working, you will need to create an `NPM_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_TOKEN` in your repository settings. You should also install the [Changesets bot](https://github.com/apps/changeset-bot) on your GitHub repository as well.

For more information about this automation, refer to the official [changesets documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/automating-changesets.md)
